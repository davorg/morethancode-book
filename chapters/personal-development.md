# Personal development

In the previous chapter, we looked at how you can better help your company
achieve its goals. In this chapter we'll be a bit more selfish and see how
you can benefit from your work. This will take two forms. We'll look at how
you can be more successful within the the company, but we'll also talk about
how you can build a reputation outside of your company and become a key
person of influence in your industry.

## Two (or five or ten) year plan

The best way to ensure that your career is heading towards a place where you
want it to be, is to know what you're aiming for. In other words, you're far
more likely to get somewhere interesting if you know where you're heading as
you set out.

Do you know what you want to be doing in two years? Or five or ten years? I
realise that might be a tricky question to answer in an industry that changes
as quickly as ours does, but that shouldn't prevent you from having some
kind of roadmap - even if it's something that you revisit and replan every
couple of years.

Most companies will have some kind of annual review process. You could use
that as the basis for your plan. In my experience, the annual review will
often only concentrate on the next year, but there's nothing to stop you using
a similar process to plan further ahead - either as part of your review with
the help of a friendly manager or as something that you do by yourself.

The output from an annual review will usually be a list of goals that you
want to achieve over the next years. These goals should be SMART, that is they
should have the following attributes. They should be:

* **Specific** - defining exactly what needs to be done to meet the goal.
* **Measureable** - defining how you will measure whether you have achieved
this goal.
* **Achieveable** - something that you can be expected to achieve in the given
time period.
* **Relevant** - something that is useful to you in your job.
* **Time-dependent** - defining the time period in which you will achieve this
goal.

Examples of good goals might be something like:

* Lead a successful project that is estimated to take four weeks.
* Take technical responsibility for the some microservice by the end of
February.
* Give a talk about the architecture of your microservice by the end of April.

You should also take the time to identify any training courses will be useful
to move you to the next level in your role. While it's often tempting to
just look at hard technical training courses, don't forget that softer skills
can also be really useful.

You can use a similar goal-setting approach to set targets for your
longer-term career. The further ahead you are planning, the vaguer your plans
can be, but you should still make a note of them somewhere so that you can
revisit them (and, hopefully, tighten them up) when their deadlines get
closer.

## Career structure

Different companies will, of course, have different career structures. But one
common approach is to have a management stream and a technical stream, with
employees able to choose which of the two they are most drawn to.

The management stream is the more traditional approach. When you show that you
are good at a job, you get promoted to a position where you manage other people
who are doing the same job. As a programmer, you would become a team leader
and then, eventually, a development manager. Over time, you would spend less
of your day doing actual programming work and more or it helping other
programmers with their work. You would get more involved with the internal
politics of your company but, in return, you would get to make a bigger impact
on the business by driving larger projects. You would become the line manager
for people in your team, running their annual reviews, helping them with
career advice and even being involved in setting their salary levels.

While the management stream has you managing people, there's another, more
technical route you can take where you're managing systems rather people.
Instead of taking responsibility for a team of developers, you might look after
a specific area of the system. In our current world of microservices you might
take technical ownership of one or two microservices. You become the person
who knows the technical details of those systems and who decides how new
features are going to be implemented. In time you might become a technical
architect for large parts of the system. Like a team leader, you will
eventually find yourself spending less time writing code and more time in
architectural meetings, sketching possible system designs on whiteboards. In
exchange, you will drive the technical direction of the parts of the system
you are responsible for and this is a great way to have a large impact on the
way the company's systems work.

Don't get too hung up on job titles. They don't mean much in the IT industry.
No-one has ever put much effort into calibrating them. Each company has its own
version. How senior is a senior programmer? How junior is a junior programmer?
Does becoming a senior programmer mean that you've contributed something at
a senior level? Or does it just mean that you've been a the company for a
certain amount of time?

I've often seen job titles used as an incentive. But unless they come with
more interesting work (and, hopefully, an increase in salary) they mean
nothing. I was once being interviewed for a job and was asked where I saw
myself in a few years time. I talked about wanting to be a software architect.
When I was offered the job, it was with the job title software architect. But,
in reality, it was just a standard senior developer role with responsibilities
(and a salary) commensurate with that role.

It's also worth noting that (particularly in start-ups) development groups
often have a rather flat structure. I've lost count of the number of times
I've worked in a team where my manager is only one level away from the CTO.
This means that there's not much space to promote people and in an
environment like that people often place a lot more importance in job titles.

## Internal self-marketing

If you want to be successful within your company then it helps if the
management in the company knows who you are. This might be described as
"internal self-marketing". Some people have a natural ability for becoming
known in a group without really thinking about it, but (at the risk of
stereotyping slightly) many people who make good developers don't have that
skill and have to work at it.

It starts with being sociable. When you're in the kitchen making your coffee,
look around and make eye contact with people. Talk to them. Ask them what they
do in the company. Maybe your kitchen is only used by the developers, in which
case it's worth making occasional sorties to other kitchens in the office
(pretend that your kitchen has run out of milk or something like that).

The next step is to go to lunch with people. If your team doesn't go to
lunch together regularly, then see if you can instigate it. Or, when a project,
launches successfully suggest a lunch for all the people involved (you might
even get a budget for it). The advantage of a project lunch is that it,
hopefully, won't just involve the technical team, you'll also get to meet
some of the stakeholders and business users of whatever you've been working on.

But the best socialising happens after work. Either in a restaurant or (more
likely) in the local pub. That's when you can really get to know people. Even
better if it's in a pub following a quarterly all-hands company meeting.
Everyone will be there and there's probably a few quid behind the bar. If the
pub isn't your usual hangout or you're not much of a drinker, it's well worth
making the effort to go along for a while and get to know people.

It's the cross-team conversations that happen in situations like that which
really make it worth your time. I've had situation where I've been talking to
someone who uses some back-office system that I maintain and they've mentioned
a little problem they've had with the system. I've realised that it would only
take a tiny tweak to the code to remove that niggle and the following day I've
raised a ticket to fix the problem and it gets done in the next development
sprint. That's one more person amongst our users who thinks I'm a person who
gets things done. Which is never a bad thing. There's a chance that the user
would never have thought of mentioning that problem through the usual
ticketing channels, but after a couple of pints he mentioned it and it was
fixed soon afterwards.

I mentioned quarterly all-hands meetings. Most companies have something
similar. Everyone gets together (often in some off-site venue) and the
executive team update them on how the company is going, or announce another
massive reorganisation. That's another opportunity to become known. These
meeting always have Q&A sessions and if you can make a habit of asking
intelligent and interesting questions, then you'll soon start to be recognised
by other people. Sometimes there will be opportunities to speak at these
meetings and you should always be prepared to talk about your projects when
given the opportunity.

As a measure of how well my internal marketing is working I like to ask myself
how many of the executive team know who I am. It would be unsurprising if the
CTO didn't know my name (assuming it's not too large a company) but if the
CEO also knows me, I think I'm doing well.

## External self-marketing

Internal self-marketing is all very well, but in order to really help your
career, you should also be thinking about external self-marketing.
Internal self-marketing might get you a promotion with a decent salary rise,
but it's external self-marketing that will get you head-hunted for a new job
at Google, Facebook or whoever you would love to work for.

We will discuss four different types of external self-marketing. In order of
increasing difficulty, we have:

* Answering questions about technologies you are expert in on web sites or
mailing lists.
* Contributing to an open source project using your skills.
* Blogging about your work or the technologies that you use.
* Speaking about your work of the technologies that you use.

As is often the way, it's the items at the harder end of the list that will
have the greatest effect.

### Answering questions

There will always be people who know less about your areas of expertise than
you do. And those people will always be asking questions about those topics
on web sites like [https://stackoverflow.com/](StackOverflow) or various
mailing lists. By answering these questions you can increase your reputation
as an expert in those technologies.

For example, I'm like to answer StackOverflow questions about Perl and other
technologies that I use. Because I've been doing that for several years, I'm
now one of the highest-rated Perl experts on the site. This has had an effect
on my career. People have come up to me at conferences and told me that they
found a particular answer useful and I've been told that I've been given job
interviews because the people doing the screening recognised my name from
the site.

There are, however, plenty of other people who are answering the same questions.
So how are you going to differentiate your answers from the rest of them. I
have a few ideas.

1. **Be polite** Often the people asking these questions are new to the
technologies or even new to programming. And experienced developers can
sometimes be a little rude in the way they ask them to explain exactly what
they are trying to do. Being a little gentler and trying to understand the
original question without immediately calling the questioner an idiot can make
your answer stand out from the crowd.

1. **Be correct** I've seen cases where people are so determined to be the
first person to answer that they just post the first solution that comes to
mind. Sometime, these solutions don't even compile. It can pay to stand back a
bit and take the time to post something accurate and easy to understand.

1. **Be instructive** The person asking the question is usually up against some
kind of deadline. They will just want to get their answer as quickly as
possible. However, I still think it's worth taking the time to explain your
answer. Some of these sites have pretty good Googlejuice and it's useful to
have detailed answers to questions come up with your name attached when other
people are searching for solutions to similar problems in the future.

### Open source work

If you have certain programming skills, then a good way to advertise them is
to contribute to an open source project that requires those skills. This has
a few useful effects. You'll be getting better-known amongst the rest of the
project team. You'll be working with other people who know your technologies
of interest and that will, hopefully, improve your skills. And you'll be
contributing to something that some people will find useful.

### Writing about your work

It's likely that you have useful or interesting things to say about the
technologies that you use regularly, so why not write those down and share
them with the rest of the world.

The most obvious approach to take is to write a blog. You might not even have
to set up your own blog. More and more companies are setting up a technical
blog to share information about the technologies they are using. Mostly, I
think, they are using it as a recruitment tool - "Hey, look at all the cool
stuff we're doing; wanna come and join us?" - but we can use this to our
advantage by writing articles with our name attached and publishing them on
the company blog. You'll need to find out who is responsible for organising
the blog and ask them how you go about proposing and writing an article. There
will probably (hopefully!) be some kind of editing process that your article
needs to go through before being published. The company will only want
high-quality posts on their public-facing blog site and there will also be
some level of negotiation about what you can write about. Some of your work
will be too commercially sensitive to be made public. If the company doesn't
already have a technical blog, then you just found yourself a project that will
also help with your internal self-marketing. And a shared blog like this will
put less pressure on you to keep producing content than starting your own blog.

If you do want to start your own blog, then there are many options open to you.
The *de facto* standard blog platform is WordPress. It's available in two
versions. There's a hosted version at [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/)
or you can install the software from [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/)
and install it on your own server (assuming you have your own server). The
self-hosted version will give you more flexibility in how you run your blog,
but you will also be responsible for installing regular security updates
(as the most popular software for building web sites, WordPress is also where
many unscrupulous people concentrate their hacking efforts).

But WordPress isn't the only option. Many people like
[Medium](https://medium.com/). I've posted a number of programming articles
there and I like the site. The only slight downside for a technical blog is
that it can be hard to post code in a readable format (but I believe you can
work round that by using GitHub gists). Medium has a ready-made audience and
one advantage is that you can make your work available for access through the
site's paywall - which means that you might get paid for your work.

[Dev](https://dev.to/) is another hosted web site that is aimed firmly at the
development community. Posts to the site are written as Markdown documents and
it therefore happily supports including code samples. If your posts are going
to largely technical in nature, then this site would be a good choice.

Another, more manual approach is to use
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This is a system for creating web
sites hosted in GitHub repositories. It has built-in support for a site builder
called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which makes it simple to convert
Markdown documents into good-looking web pages. It takes more work than
something like WordPress but people like the level of control that is gives
them.

Of course, blogging is not the only option open to you when it comes to
writing about your work. There are magazines (both print and online) that
could be interesting in publishing articles about your work. Most of them will
even pay you for an article. You might well find that building a following for
a blog about your areas of expertise will open doors to writing articles.

And then, of course, there are books. Traditionally you would pitch an idea
for a book to publisher (or, less often, a publisher would approach you, as
an expert, with an idea) and they would work with you to get your work into
bookshops. That option is still open to you, but the emergence of ebooks has
opened up another route. You can now write your book completely on your own.
upload it to Amazon (or other ebook marketplaces) and keep all of the income
for yourself instead of getting a 10-15% royalty as you might get from a
traditional publisher. That might sound attractive, but remember that the
publishers do actually do useful work for their share of the money. They will
supply people to proofread and edit your book. They will design covers and
deal with allocating an ISBN. They will then deal with marketing and
distribution. With the ebook route, you'll get a larger percentage of the
money but you'll probably need to pay professionals to do some the things
that a publisher would do for you. This will, obviously, eat into the amount
of money you make.

### Speaking about your work
